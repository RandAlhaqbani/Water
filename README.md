# 💧 Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 🌍 **Project Overview**  
This project applies **machine learning classification models** to predict whether a given water sample is **safe or unsafe** for consumption. The model is trained on key water quality parameters such as **pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity**, and more. The model is integrated into a **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to make real-time predictions.

## 🚀 **Key Features**  
✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned missing values, applied feature scaling, and encoded categorical variables.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified correlations and trends in water quality parameters.  
✅ **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and compared multiple classification models:  
   - 📈 Logistic Regression *(Best accuracy model)*  
   - 🌲 Random Forest  
   - 🔺 Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - 🌳 Decision Tree  
   - 📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
✅ **Model Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.  
✅ **Web Application**: Developed an **interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** 🐍 Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
